- While trying to build this app, I put a lot of react concepts i've gained into practice.
- I learnt how to use axios, and how it is better than fetch with slightly better code and browser compatibility. However, using it with async-await should be done carefully as async-await is ES-2017.
- I practiced creating dark mode toggle functionality for a simple react app. This particular one also uses localstorage to save the user's previous color choice.
- I practiced the concepts of props, state and the different ways of approaching conditional rendering.
- I also learnt about and used the react useEffect hook.
- I practiced list displaying in react using map.
- I figured out how to use react-icons, an icon-library of icon-libraries, for react apps.

- Overall, buiding this simple app has improved my understanding of the react library and ecosystem, and I will definately build more apps using react.js .
